# Predicting Rent Price Airbnb - Kaggle Competition
**Description**
People interested in renting an apartment or home, share information about themselves and their property on Airbnb. Those who end up renting the property 
share their experiences through reviews. The dataset describes property, host, and reviews for over 35,000 Airbnb rentals in New York along 90 variables.*
**Goal**
Construct a model using the dataset supplied and use it to predict the price of a set of Airbnb rentals included in scoringData.csv.
**Metric**
Submissions will be evaluated based on RMSE (root mean squared error). Lower the RMSE, better the model.
